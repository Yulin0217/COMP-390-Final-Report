Rendering is a core technology to show a variety of graphic effects, which has been attached great importance to and applied by the whole society. Nowadays, although the rendering of large-scale and complex scenes has a wide range of applications, the actual optimization requirements are very high. Therefore, in the future technology application and research and development, based on higher and higher technical requirements, it is necessary to improve the efficiency of actual rendering while ensuring or improving the rendering quality. Therefore, this paper studies how to use the algorithm to improve the efficiency of actual rendering, so as to provide a new basis for future computer graphics research.}

This study is a preliminary evaluation to detail technical challenges, potential bottlenecks, and accuracy of the proposed object- and tool-aware AR-assisted fabrication systems. In the designed workflow, computer vision tools and sensors are used to implement an inside-out tracking technique for retrofitted drills based on a reverse engineering approach. The approach allows workers to perform complex drilling angle operations according to computer-processed feedback instead of drawing, marking, or jigs. First, the developed methodology was presented, and its various devices and functioning phases were detailed. Second, this first proof of concept was evaluated by experimentally scanning produced drillings and comparing the discrepancies with their respective three-dimensional execution models. This study outlined improvements in the proposed tool-aware fabrication process and clarified the potential role of augmented carpentry in the digital fabrication landscape.}

  abstract = {Abstract Adaptive exponential smoothing methods allow a smoothing parameter to change over time, in order to adapt to changes in the characteristics of the time series. However, these methods have tended to produce unstable forecasts and have performed poorly in empirical studies. This paper presents a new adaptive method, which enables a smoothing parameter to be modelled as a logistic function of a user-specified variable. The approach is analogous to that used to model the time-varying parameter in smooth transition models. Using simulated data, we show that the new approach has the potential to outperform existing adaptive methods and constant parameter methods when the estimation and evaluation samples both contain a level shift or both contain an outlier. An empirical study, using the monthly time series from the M3-Competition, gave encouraging results for the new approach. Copyright © 2004 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract = {Abstract Exponential smoothing has been one of the most popular forecasting methods used to support various decisions in organizations, in activities such as inventory management, scheduling, revenue management, and other areas. Although its relative simplicity and transparency have made it very attractive for research and practice, identifying the underlying trend remains challenging with significant impact on the resulting accuracy. This has resulted in the development of various modifications of trend models, introducing a model selection problem. With the aim of addressing this problem, we propose the complex exponential smoothing (CES), based on the theory of functions of complex variables. The basic CES approach involves only two parameters and does not require a model selection procedure. Despite these simplifications, CES proves to be competitive with, or even superior to existing methods. We show that CES has several advantages over conventional exponential smoothing models: it can model and forecast both stationary and non-stationary processes, and CES can capture both level and trend cases, as defined in the conventional exponential smoothing classification. CES is evaluated on several forecasting competition datasets, demonstrating better performance than established benchmarks. We conclude that CES has desirable features for time series modeling and opens new promising avenues for research.},
